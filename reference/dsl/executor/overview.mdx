The Executor module provides the execution engine for processing queries and managing the computational workflow of Superlinked applications across different execution modes.

## Core Executor Components

Foundation components for query execution:

  <Card 
    title="Executor" 
    icon="play" 
    href="/reference/dsl/executor/executor"
  >
    Base executor class and core execution functionality
  </Card>
  <Card 
    title="Exception" 
    icon="triangle-exclamation" 
    href="/reference/dsl/executor/exception"
  >
    Exception handling for executor operations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Execution Modes

Choose the appropriate executor type for your deployment needs:

  >
    REST API descriptor and metadata management
  </Card>
  <Card 
    title="REST Handler"

## Key Features

Executor components provide:

- **Multiple Execution Modes**: Support for various deployment and execution patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Choose the right executor for your performance needs
- **Scalability**: From local development to distributed production execution
- **API Integration**: Built-in REST API execution capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management during execution

<Info>
Different executor types are optimized for specific execution scenarios. In-memory executors provide fast local execution, while REST executors enable web service deployment.
</Info>

## Executor Selection Guide

Choose the right executor type for your use case:

- **In Memory Executor**: Best for development, testing, and high-performance local execution
- **Interactive Executor**: Ideal for experimentation, prototyping, and iterative development
- **Query Executor**: Specialized for query-focused applications and search services
- **REST Executor**: Perfect for web applications and API-based services

<Tip>
Start with In Memory Executor during development for fast iteration, then transition to REST Executor for production web service deployment.
</Tip>

## Execution Workflow

Executors handle the complete processing pipeline:

1. **Query Processing**: Parse and validate incoming queries
2. **Vector Computation**: Execute vector operations and similarity calculations
3. **Result Generation**: Compile and format query results
4. **Response Delivery**: Return results through the appropriate interface
5. **Error Management**: Handle exceptions and provide meaningful error responses

## Performance Considerations

Executors optimize for:

- **Computation Speed**: Efficient vector operations and similarity calculations
- **Memory Management**: Optimal memory usage during query execution
- **Concurrency**: Support for parallel query processing
- **Resource Utilization**: Balanced use of CPU and memory resources
