The Schema module provides the foundational components for defining data structures and validating data integrity within the Superlinked framework.

## Schema Components

Define and manage your data structures with robust schema components:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card 
    title="Schema" 
    icon="database" 
    href="/reference/common/schema/schema"
  >
    Core schema definition and management functionality
  </Card>
  <Card 
    title="Schema Object" 
    icon="cube" 
    href="/reference/common/schema/schema_object"
  >
    Individual schema object definitions and properties
  </Card>
  <Card 
    title="Event Schema" 
    icon="calendar-clock" 
    href="/reference/common/schema/event_schema"
  >
    Specialized schemas for event-based data structures
  </Card>
  <Card 
    title="Event Schema Object" 
    icon="calendar-days" 
    href="/reference/common/schema/event_schema_object"
  >
    Event-specific schema object definitions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card 
    title="ID Schema Object" 
    icon="fingerprint" 
    href="/reference/common/schema/id_schema_object"
  >
    Specialized schema objects for identifier management
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Features

Schema components provide:

- **Type Safety**: Strong typing and validation for all data fields
- **Flexibility**: Support for various data types and structures
- **Event Handling**: Specialized schemas for time-based event data
- **Validation**: Automatic data validation and error handling
- **Consistency**: Ensures data consistency across the entire pipeline

<Tip>
Schema definitions serve as the foundation for all data processing operations in Superlinked. Properly defined schemas ensure optimal performance and data integrity.
</Tip>

## Usage Patterns

Schemas are typically used to:

1. **Define Data Structure**: Establish the expected format of your input data
2. **Validate Input**: Ensure incoming data meets the defined requirements
3. **Enable Processing**: Allow downstream components to process data efficiently
4. **Track Changes**: Monitor data evolution over time with event schemas
